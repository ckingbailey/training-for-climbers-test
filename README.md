I took this self-assessment test from _Training for Climbing_ by Eric J HÃ¶rst.

Take the test [here](https://pedantic-lumiere-9af0c4.netlify.app).

If you want to run it locally
1. Pull the repo
2. `$ npm install`
3. Serve the public/ folder somehow. I like to use [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve), which I have globally installed
    - `$ npm i -g serve`
    - `$ serve public # your app is now being served on localhost:5000`
4. If you're developing, you can watch for file changes in src and recompile EJS on change
    - `$ npm run dev`
